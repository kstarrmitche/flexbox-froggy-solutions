### The differences between `space-around,` `space-evenly`, and `space-between`

```css
justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute items evenly
                                   The first item is flush with the start,
                                   the last is flush with the end */
justify-content: space-around;  /* Distribute items evenly
                                   Items have a half-size space
                                   on either end */
justify-content: space-evenly;  /* Distribute items evenly
                                   Items have equal space around them */ 
```
